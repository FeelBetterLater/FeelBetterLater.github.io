<p>What makes someone a great therapist for you?</p>



<p>Most importantly, you need to have a great connection. The best therapist in the world won’t mesh with everyone, and it can take several trials to finally get this right. Good therapists want you to ask for a trial session to see if they are a good fit. You won’t offend anyone by walking away if you don’t mesh.</p>



<p>When you find a match, the next step is to establish shared goals. “I like my therapist and I’m not sure it’s helping” is a common concern. Don’t be afraid to ask for change. Every therapist wants feedback about what is and isn’t working. The best will often check in about how the therapy is progressing. If they don’t ask if things are working, you can bring it up. You’re not going to hurt anyone’s feelings.</p>



<p>After developing a good connection and shared goals, it’s important to determine if the skills and form of therapy has evidence to treat your problem. This is what people mean when they use confusing acronyms (CBT, DBT, or ACT, etc.), and cryptic terms (psychodynamic, interpersonal, etc.). You’ll often hear phrases like “CBT works for anxiety.” That is true for many, and it’s still probably less important than having a great connection and shared goals with a therapist. There are many ways to solve most problems, and honest experts often disagree. (My bias has always been towards the so-called “evidence-based” therapies. For some problems, I’m almost always going to recommend a three-letter-acronym treatment. But most of the time, the specific form of therapy doesn’t matter as much as my theory-driven mind would suggest it does).</p>



<p>People often start at the wrong end: choosing a type of therapy rather than starting with connection. That can work if there are multiple experts to choose from. But when your access to therapy is constrained (as it almost always is), it’s usually best to find a good fit first.</p>

<p>Last week, I wrote about <a href="https://feelbetterlater.github.io/the-cardinal-rule-of-mental-health/">the cardinal rule of mental health</a>: that your only real option to improve any situation is to change your behavior.</p>



<p>It’s a simple principle that bears repeating. But there are some relevant counterarguments that are worth addressing.</p>



<p>Another option to improve your mental health would be to wait and change nothing. You can do this if you wish, and there is a chance that things will get better without extra effort on your part. But more likely than not, you’ll continue repeating the same patterns until things get worse.</p>



<p>(As an aside, choosing to accept things as they are is very different than choosing to do nothing. Acceptance is an active process that is often foundational for change. We often achieve only cursory acceptance: we deny the full weight of the situation; identify problems and yet brush aside consequences; or we fail to explore the parts of our problems that could actually be changed. Change accelerates when we wholeheartedly accept that we have been doing the best we can with the motivation, skills, habits and biases we have, <em>and</em> that we need to try harder, be more motivated, and learn to do better. Acceptance and change are siblings; they don’t need to be rivals.)</p>



<p>Others might question the cardinal rule by stating that someone else might be the problem, and you can ask them to change. Of course you can, but it doesn’t invalidate the cardinal rule. Your influence can only come by changing the way you interact with other people. You decide what you do. They decide how they respond. You don’t get to choose their reaction.</p>



<p>In a healthy relationship, influencing another comes through mutual respect, example, kindness, honesty, open communication, occasional frankness, patience, and forgiveness. Positive interactions are much more likely to help someone discover and act upon their internal motivation than criticism and negativity.</p>



<p>Force isn’t a great option. There are a few exceptions. Parenting young children. Protecting someone from truly dangerous behavior. Individuals and societies have important duties to rarely use force. But the line between wise use of force and abuse will always be debated. And when you get this wrong&#8211;and you will&#8211;you risk resentment and backlash. Let your default be patience, kindness, and gentle persuasion. Control rarely works.</p>



<p>There’s so much more to be said. But the basics are clear. Choose to do something that makes your life better. Start small, but start.</p>

<p>How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb?</p>



<p>It’s a dumb joke, and I’ll let you suffer through it. But first, let’s talk about relationships.</p>



<p>Every relationship is more than just two people. There is an unspoken middle ground called the <em>relationship system</em>, a constantly evolving construct defined by the interactions between two people. In other words: how I act influences you, and how you behave affects me. Relationship systems have a memory, and past events color how we see each other. A good relationship system can produce trust, shared experience, and so much more. And when people have problems with each other, it’s usually best to start looking at flaws in the relationship system before trying to find fault in either party.</p>



<p>How do you improve a relationship? You have some control over your own behaviors, a little control over the relationship system, and absolutely no control over the other person.</p>



<p>To strengthen relationships, it helps to understand what I call <em>the cardinal rule of mental health</em>: your only real option to improve any situation is to change your behavior. That doesn’t mean that everything is your fault. It’s an acknowledgment that you wait for something unexpected to happen, change your approach, or leave. But you’ll never, ever, be able to force real change in someone else. You can ask them for change, support them, antagonize them, or even cut them off. No one strategy works in every situation. And yet all reasonable options start and end with you.</p>



<p>I’m not trying to minimize the capacity for change in others. I am fundamentally optimistic about our capacity to improve, despite the very real forces of <a href="https://feelbetterlater.github.io/why-is-it-so-hard-to-change/">ambivalence and habit</a>. There are reasons why we do what we do, and reasons we want to do better. A good therapist digs deep to uncover motivation, but they can’t build on something that isn’t there. It’s rare outside of therapy to have the permission, skill, and safety to probe others this way. Instead, you get to decide if you can tolerate what’s happening right now.</p>



<p>That is the textbook definition of a boundary: “you can’t do this to me and expect our relationship to continue as it is.” How do you enforce a boundary? By changing your part in the relationship. You don’t have the power to do anything else.</p>



<p>How many psychiatrists does it take to change a lightbulb? How many people does it take to have a positive influence? One. But some small part of the lightbulb has to want to change itself. You don&#8217;t have to spend the rest of your life clinging to lightbulbs that refuse to budge. </p>
