<p>If you’re tossed in a pool, thrashing wildly is the worst thing you can do. But if it’s never happened before, how would you know better?</p>



<p>You can learn to tread water. A coordinated effort between your limbs will keep your head in the air. Erratic motions make you sink.</p>



<p>And if you know how to swim, you can propel yourself to the edge of the pool.</p>



<p>All these skills take practice. Unless you have them, it can easily feel like you’re drowning. Start simply: Try holding still. Stop thrashing. Focus on breathing. Feel the way that the water pushes on you&#8211;upward, not downward. You float. (And unlike a pool, anxiety can’t hurt you. It’s painful. It passes.)</p>



<p>So start small. It will get better. But fighting against it will never work. You have to learn to move with the water.</p>
